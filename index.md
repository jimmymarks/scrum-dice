##Scrum Dice!

###Scrum Dice!

The Scrum methodology of software development is very popular and, when applied correctly, makes great things happen. A key element of Scrum is the "__Daily Scrum__," a stand-up meeting where devs talk about the previous day's work, their daily outlook, and any blockers they might have.

While the Daily Scrum can be helpful and enlightening, it can also be the most arduous waste of a half-hour (or full hour...or two hours) of your day.

Developers sometimes have trouble focusing and getting their point across. They'll forget details. They'll pontificate. They'll go off on rants. They'll quote <cite>The Simpsons</cite> for sixty-three minutes continuously. They'll get lost.

Ideally, the "Scrum Master" will drive the would-be-quick meeting forward. But sometimes, even the best Scrum Master needs assistance.

##Enter Scrum Dice!

Scrum dice is a simple system. In fact, it's barely a system. It is two things:

1. Two six-sided dice (2 d6, for the D&D set)
2. The following table

| Roll | Time to Speak |
|------|---------------|
| 2    | 0:30          |
| 3    | 0:45          |
| 4    | 1:00          |
| 5    | 1:15          |
| 6    | 1:30          |
| 7    | 1:45          |
| 8    | 2:00          |
| 9    | 2:15          |
| 10   | 2:30          |
| 11   | 2:45          |
| 12   | 3:00          |

###Here's how it works:

Your speaker rolls the dice. Whatever number they get, you multiply by fifteen seconds. That's how long they get to speak. Period.

If they want to take the time to field questions in their alotted time, that's their business. If they want to cede the rest of their time to another dev, that's up to them. They get all the time they're given and not a second more.

###But does it work?

Let's say you have seven devs.

If each has three full minutes to talk, that's a minimum of 21 minutes of talk time. Tack on three minutes for diversions and sidebars (and the general howdedoo) and what do you get? Twenty-four minutes for a meeting that should reasonably take fifteen (and *top out* at twenty on your worst day).

So, let's use a dice simulator (at [dicesimulator.com](dicesimulator.com)).

- Dev 1 gets a 7 – 1:45
- Dev 2 gets an 8 – 2:00
- Dev 3 gets a 3 – 0:45
- Dev 4 gets an 8 – 2:00  
- Dev 5 gets a 9 – 2:15
- Dev 6 gets a 5 – 1:15  
- Dev 7 gets a 5 – 1:15  

Add those times up and you get 11 minutes and 15 seconds. Add three minutes for chatter and you get 14 minutes and 15 seconds. __That's under fifteen minutes!__

Our team implemented Scrum Dice! and it has gone very well. It turns Scrum into a kind of game and everyone loves the challenge of squeezing their update into the time they get from a low roll.
